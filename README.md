# SNN-network-for-phototaxis
A Spiking Neural Network to model a model phototaxis which is common in primitive life form.Photo-taxis refers to the innate behavioral response of organisms when excited by stimuli like light. It is an outcome of the motility (independent capacity to move using metabolic energy) of certain organisms when it finds certain stimuli .They use sensors in their body.

# Spiking Neural Networks

Spiking neural networks (SNN) have first emerged in computational neuroscience, as an attempt to model the behavior of biological neurons. This has resulted in the Leaky-Integrate-and- Fire (LIF) model, describing neuronal activity as
integration of received spike voltages and weak dissipation (leakage) to the environment. When its voltage reaches a threshold, the neuron fires a spike on its own. Following further inspiration from the brain, neuronal inputs and outputs can be encoded
in the time or rate of the spikes that it receives and emits. This type of information encoding is very robust to errors because a failure to detect a spike or two doesnâ€™t induce a significant error on the average spike rate.
